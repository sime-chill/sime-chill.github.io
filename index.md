# **About me**
I am a second-year M.S. student studying electronic and information engineering in the <a href="http://www.it.fudan.edu.cn/">School of Information Science and Technology</a> at Fudan University (FDU) where I am advised by <a href="http://www.it.fudan.edu.cn/Data/View/1139">Prof. Zhuo Zou</a>. 
I am also with the <a href="https://asic-skl.fudan.edu.cn/">State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University</a>.
Before that, I received my B.E. degree in microelectronics science and engineering from the <a href="https://seit.sysu.edu.cn/">School of Electronics and Information Technology (School of Microelectronis)</a> at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU).

I have a broad interest in **low-power digital intergrated circuit (IC) design** and the **memory-centric neuromorphic computing architecture**.
